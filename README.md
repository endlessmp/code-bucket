# Code Bucket
A place to collect curated, well commented, snippets of code examples for everyone!
## The idea
Every developer knows the problem: You are faced with a certain task that you want to implement with a specific library 
and now you are looking for examples that show this library in its implementation. But in the official docs there are, if at all, only one-liners 
or only explanations without examples.
There remains only Google and Stack Overflow. One month later you have forgotten this code and have to google for it again and you are annoyed,
why didn't I save the code? And what would happen if Stack Overflow is down some day?!
If you're actually already using a snippet manager, it's probably on your own. And another developer also keeps a snippet collection
for himself alone.

Paul also knows this problem. And he thought, why don't we all together keep a well commented, curated snippet collection for all possible
programming languages, libraries, tools and other tasks we encounter again and again in our daily lives?

Code Bucket has been born!
