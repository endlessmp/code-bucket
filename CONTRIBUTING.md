# Contribution Guidelines
This file will be edited in more detail soon. We still need to find the perfect structure to collect code snippets.

## General Guidelines
1. Only Markdown Files: We tried witch all different kind of file endings and it only confuses the ides if you checkout this repo. So let´s stay with markdown for the moment.
2. Use Code Higlight in Markdown: You cana nonetheless highlight your code language specific if you open the code block with the three backtickts and then write your language directly behind the starting backticks. See https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting
3. Use the naming scheme for your file: Right now we name it pretty much like the thing it does. Except without the language, framework or any information that is already contained in the folder structure, the file is in. In addition to that, all words need to be lowercase and joined by an underscore ( _ ).

## Use-Cases

 ### Use-Case 1: A simple utility method in a specific language
Let´s say you want to showcase how to read a file as a string in java. For this one, you need to go to the languages folder -> Java of course and then in the correct library/ framework folder. For basic Java things, there is the JDK folder. This folder is structured like the official JDK, that means you have to look in which package your explanation could belong. For reading files, base/IO seems to match.

### Use-Case 2: Annoying Git commands, you always forget
Let´s say you always forget how to set a new remote for a git repo. Git is located under the Tools folder. Right now every Git snippet is located directly in this folder. In the future, we may split it in more sub folders. If you think it is time for that, create a pull request with your idea. Thank you for that!

## More soon

More to come ... (And many things will change anyways)

Thank you for contributing and bringing some structure in our beloved bucket!
